We Humans.

We are privilege seeking creatures. We are engulfed in a bubble that we've created for ourselves, where, we compare each other, based on, not what we are or do, but what we possess and how we are perceived.

We, humans, are stupid.

Step outside your shoes. Go places. Meet people. Drop your material attachments.

Garner experiences that make you richer. Collect smiles from people you help. Talk to people. Talk to the earth. Don't do it for an instagram moment, or a facebook like. Just do it -- for it.

Become better.

Stop complaining.

Invent. Reinvent. Live and Love.
